## 🎯 Challenges Faced & Solutions

### Challenge 1: State Management
*Problem*: Managing complex state across multiple components
*Solution*: Implemented React Context API with TypeScript for type-safe global state management

### Challenge 2: Form Validation
*Problem*: Real-time validation without external libraries
*Solution*: Created custom validation logic with immediate feedback and error handling

### Challenge 3: Responsive Design
*Problem*: Ensuring consistent experience across devices
*Solution*: Used Tailwind's responsive utilities with mobile-first approach

### Challenge 4: Component Architecture
*Problem*: Maintaining clean, reusable component structure
*Solution*: Separated concerns with dedicated components for each feature

## 📝 Code Quality

- TypeScript for type safety
- Clean component architecture
- Consistent naming conventions
- Proper error handling
- Accessible design patterns
